# AliCooks Ideas Backlog

A place to capture enhancement ideas and future features. Add freely — this is for brainstorming,
not commitment. Ideas here may or may not make it into the product.

**How to use this doc:**

- Jot down ideas when they come to you
- Don't overthink — capture the spark, refine later
- Periodically review and promote promising ideas to proper specs

## Dish Enhancements

Ideas for enriching the dish data model beyond name + type.

### Extended Dish Details

**Added**: 2024-12-18

Allow users to optionally add more context to dishes:

- **Cook Time** — How long does this take? (e.g., "30 min", "1 hour")
- **Difficulty** — Quick weeknight vs. weekend project
- **Notes** — Free-form personal notes ("Dad's favorite", "needs cast iron")

*Consideration*: Keep these optional. The constitution says first-run must work without
configuration — adding a dish should still be fast and friction-free.

### Recipe Links

**Added**: 2024-12-18

Link a dish to an external recipe source:

- Instagram post/reel demonstrating the recipe
- YouTube video
- Blog post or website URL
- Maybe even a TikTok

*Consideration*: This is about reference, not storage. AliCooks isn't a recipe manager
(out of scope per constitution), but linking to where Aliya learned a dish could be helpful.

## Social & Sharing

Ideas related to sharing or multi-user features.

### Household Meal Voting

**Added**: 2024-12-18

Share a meal suggestion with household members and let them vote — like or reject the idea
before committing to dinner. Takes the guesswork out of "what does everyone want?"

*Consideration*: Multi-household features are out of scope for v1 per constitution. Would
require user accounts, sharing mechanism (link? app invite?), and real-time or async voting
UI. Big feature, but addresses a real pain point for families.
