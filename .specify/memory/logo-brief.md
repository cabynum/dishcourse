## AI Generation Strategy

### Tool Selection
**Midjourney v6** chosen over DALL-E 3 because:
- Superior artistic quality for stylized work
- `--style raw` produces cleaner, logo-appropriate results
- Better at capturing sophisticated line-art style
- More control over aesthetic refinement

### Primary Prompt
```
Professional logo mark, friendly anthropomorphic plate character 
with open mouth speaking, single continuous line illustration. 
Minimalist geometric style, works in solid black or solid white. 
Sophisticated and timeless like Crumbl cookie logo. Clean edges, 
no gradients, no text, no background elements. Simple iconic 
design suitable for app icon. White background.
--ar 1:1 --style raw --v 6.1
```

## Midjourney Tips

- `/imagine` + paste prompt
- Each generation produces 4 variations
- **V1, V2, V3, V4** — Create variations of specific image
- **U1, U2, U3, U4** — Upscale specific image
- Enable **Remix mode** (`/settings`) to tweak between variations
- Use web UI at midjourney.com for cleaner experience
