## DishCourse Idea Capture

Add this idea to the backlog at `.specify/memory/ideas.md`.

### Instructions

1. **Parse the idea** from what the user said after the command
2. **Ask which category** it belongs to (or suggest one):
   - Dish Enhancements
   - Social & Sharing
   - UI/UX Ideas
   - Smart Features
   - Technical Improvements
3. **Add it to the file** under the appropriate section using this format:

```markdown
### [Brief Title]

**Added**: [Today's date]

[Description of the idea in 1-3 sentences]

*Consideration*: [Any notes about scope, complexity, or constitution alignment]
```

1. **Confirm** what was added (brief summary)

### Keep It Light

- Don't overthink — capture the spark, refine later
- One idea per entry (split if user gives multiple)
- Constitution considerations are optional but helpful
