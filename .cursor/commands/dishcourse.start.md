## DishCourse Session Start

Please read these files to get up to speed on the DishCourse project:

1. **Constitution** (project principles): `.specify/memory/constitution.md`
2. **Session Guide** (current status): `.specify/memory/session-guide.md`

After reading, provide:

### Status Summary

- Current phase and branch
- What was completed last session
- Any open decisions

### Proposed Next Steps

Read the "Recommended Next Steps" section from the session guide and **propose these options to the user**. Don't just list them — explain what each option involves and make a recommendation.

Then ask: "Which approach would you like to take, or did you have something else in mind?"
