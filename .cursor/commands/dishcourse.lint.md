## DishCourse Lint Check

Please run a lint check on all markdown files in the project:

1. Check these directories for markdown linting errors:
   - `blog/`
   - `specs/`
   - `.specify/memory/`
   - Root `.md` files

2. Report any errors found

3. Fix all errors before continuing

This should be run before any commit and at the end of editing sessions.
